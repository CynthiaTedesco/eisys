  "background.paragraph2":"By understanding the need for a different proposal in terms of Content Management, as well as the demands and the requirements of the current market, Francisco Boccalatte (our CEO) tried to cristallize his vision and ideas. Thus Eisys was created as a convergence point of the experience that the professionals of this specialization have.

  "working.paragraph1": "In Eisys, we believe in the triad of knowledge, combined methodologies and perception of our clients' needs. The first element is strengthened not only by experience, but also by continuous training, which we consider essential to create solutions using cutting-edge technology and standards. The second element implies a specific and innovative way of working that combines Oracle methodologies and our own methods and that guarantees a pertaining follow-up of each project, as well as the delivery of the final product in due time and proper form. The third element involves talking to the client, understanding his situation, making an adequate data-gathering and proposing the system that best fits his daily needs.",
  "working.paragraph2": "In all our projects, we jointly agree with the client on the scope of the solution. Afterwards,  such solution is implemented in a test environment, then it is approved through User Approval Tests (UATs) and finally it is deployed to a production instance. During this process, we carry out a constant follow-up of the project and we inform the client about the progress we make. In Eisys, we consider that our clients' time is very important; therefore, we commit to meet all agreed deadlines so that the project adds value to the business when the clients need it.",
  "working.paragraph3": "It is worth mentioning that once we conclude a project, we offer a support and maintenance service; its main purpose is to ensure both the optimum performance of the solution we implemented and its maximum uptime in the environment of the client. In order to provide this service, we use modern tools and cutting-edge technologies that allow for not only the proper management of each support request, but also its traceability. Furthermore, we utilize agile methodologies that contribute to reduce the reply and resolution time to a minimum.",
